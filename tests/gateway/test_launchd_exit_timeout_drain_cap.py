"""Signal-driven stops under launchd must fit the live ``ExitTimeOut``.

launchd's per-user (gui) domain clamps ``ExitTimeOut`` (measured 60s on
macOS 26: plist 215 -> live 60). A gateway configured with a longer
``restart_drain_timeout`` drains past that budget and is SIGKILLed mid
SQLite teardown — the unclean-exit half of the state.db corruption class.
The gateway therefore reads the live value at boot and caps only the
signal-driven stop drain (in-band SIGUSR1 restarts and --replace
takeovers are not launchd-timed and keep the configured drain).
